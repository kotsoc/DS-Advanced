### Programming Assignment 2: Routing in sensor networks ###

The task is to create an optimized routing algorithm for a micaz sensor network for several different topologies. The algorithmm is tested on a simulation platform writen in Python. The benchmark for the algorithm is the number of messages that are received by the drain.
